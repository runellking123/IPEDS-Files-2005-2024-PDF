## Important Notes

1. **Data Year Differences:** Sources reflect different time periods and cohorts, which explains some variation in reported rates.

2. **Methodology Differences:** Graduation rate calculations may vary by source:
   - IPEDS uses 150% normal time (6 years for bachelor's)
   - Some sources include all students vs. first-time, full-time only
   - Transfer-out rates may or may not be included

3. **Trending Concerns:** Multiple sources indicate:
   - Declining graduation rates from 2018-19 peak
   - Significant gap vs. national averages
   - High attrition rates (70% dropout among non-completers)

4. **Internal vs. External Data:** Databricks internal data (13 graduates in 2020) differs significantly from IPEDS report (186 in 2018-19), suggesting:
   - Different counting methodologies
   - Different time periods
   - Possible data quality issues requiring investigation
