## CRITICAL ISSUE: Retention Collapse

### Retention Crisis Analysis:
- **2021-2022:** 54% full-time retention
- **2022-2023:** 32% full-time retention
- **Decline:** -22 percentage points in one year

### Projected Impact:
This retention collapse will severely impact graduations for the next 4-6 years:
- Fall 2022 cohort entering with 32% retention
- Only 1 in 3 students persisting to second year
- Graduation rate of 20% (2017 cohort) already critically low
- Future graduations likely to drop below 80-90 degrees annually

## 8-Year Graduation Trajectory

| Academic Year | Total Degrees | % of 2016-17 Peak |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 2016-2017 | 271 | 100% |
| 2017-2018 | 229 | 84.5% |

| 2021-2022 | 114 | 42.1% |
| **2022-2023** | **94** | **34.7%** |

**Total decline from peak:** 65.3% reduction over 6 years

- Enrollment below 640 for first time in period
- Graduation approaching 100-degree threshold
- Recovery from 2021-22 improvements completely reversed
- Multi-year compounding effects creating crisis
