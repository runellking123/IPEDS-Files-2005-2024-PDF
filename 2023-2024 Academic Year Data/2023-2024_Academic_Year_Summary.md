### Contributing Factors Analysis

**Enrollment Trends:**
- Significant enrollment decline from peak of 1,600 (Fall 2018) to 636 (Fall 2023)
- 60% enrollment reduction over 5 years

**Retention Challenges:**
- Retention rates have been volatile, ranging from 32% to 70%
- Recent retention at 32% (Fall 2022) signals continued challenges

**Systemic Issues:**
- Low retention rates compound over time
- Small incoming cohorts + low retention = declining graduations
- Multi-year lag effect means recent low retention will impact future graduations

### Degree Program Balance
Despite overall decline, degree distribution remains balanced:
- All three major programs (BA, BS, BBA) contribute roughly equally
- No single program collapse; decline is institution-wide

### Future Outlook
Based on current trends:
- **Immediate concern:** Recent retention rates (32%) suggest continued graduation challenges
- **Enrollment impact:** Fall 2023 enrollment of 636 limits maximum potential graduates
- **Urgent action needed:** Without intervention, graduations may continue declining
