### Statistical Analysis:
- **Total decline:** 193 degrees lost (-71.2%)
- **Average annual decline:** 16.7% per year
- **Compound effect:** Retention issues from years ago manifesting now
- **Acceleration:** Decline rate not improving

## Critical Analysis

### Systemic Crisis Indicators:

**Enrollment Collapse:**
- Fall 2023: 636 students (down 60% from Fall 2018 peak of 1,600)
- Limits maximum potential graduates to ~150-200 even with perfect retention

**Retention Crisis:**
- Fall 2022 cohort: 32% retention (lowest in 8-year period)
- This cohort will graduate 2026-2028 with projected <25-30 graduates annually

**Lag Effect Compounding:**
- 2023-24 graduates entered Fall 2019-2020
- Current low retention (32%) won't impact graduations until 2026-2028
- Situation likely to worsen before improving

**Associate's Program Extinction:**
- Zero AA/AS degrees for two consecutive years
- Complete program collapse or discontinuation

### Degree Program Balance

Despite overall crisis, programs remain proportionally balanced:
- **BS:** 37.2% (science focus maintained)
- **BBA:** 32.1% (business programs stable)
- **BA:** 30.8% (arts programs comparable)

This suggests **institution-wide** rather than program-specific issues.

## Projected Future Outlook

### Worst-Case Scenario (No Intervention):
Based on 32% retention (Fall 2022):
- 2024-2025: ~65-70 degrees
- 2025-2026: ~50-60 degrees
- 2026-2027: ~40-50 degrees

### Required Actions for Stabilization:
1. Increase retention to 60%+ minimum
2. Grow enrollment to 800-900 students
3. Restore associate's programs
4. Address systemic barriers to completion

## Comparison Context

### vs. National Averages:
- National 6-year graduation rate: ~46%
- Wiley 6-year rate (2017 cohort): 20%
- **Gap:** -26 percentage points

### vs. HBCU Peers:
- Peer median graduation rate: ~32%
- Wiley current trajectory: Well below peer median
